# AI ZK-Compute

This project demonstrates a decentralized hyper-parameter search where off-chain workers train a tiny neural net, produce a Groth16 proof of their reported accuracy, and the on-chain AiOrchestrator verifies proofs and pays rewards.

It comes with:

- a Solidity orchestrator,
- a Circom circuit + verifier,
- a Python worker,
- and simple client scripts to open requests.

## What the project does

1. Client opens a job with a grid of hyper-parameters (e.g., 3 learning-rates × steps) and funds a bounty.
2. Workers each claim exactly one grid slot, train locally, generate a witness + Groth16 proof, and submit their accuracy + proof on-chain.
3. Contract verifies proofs, records accuracies, and when closed, pays 50% to the best accuracy and splits the rest equally among other proven participants.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+, pnpm 8+
- Python 3.9+ (venv recommended)
- circom 2.1.x (install via Cargo)
- snarkjs 0.6.x

circom (via cargo):
- cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/iden3/circom
snarkjs:
- pnpm i -g snarkjs

## Makefile targets

- make circuit   # compile circuit, generate zkey, wasm, and Solidity verifier
- make clear     # remove circuit artifacts + verifier (fresh rebuild)
- make nde       # compile contracts and start hardhat node
- make depl      # deploy to localhost
- make req       # open a sample request (grid + bounty)
